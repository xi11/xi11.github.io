### Research Experiences
#### _Multi-scale multi-view CNN for Alzheimer’s Disease diagnosis_  `2019.03 - 2019.12`
- Propose to learn features from different views of FDG-PET brain images, in which 3D CNN is equipped with cubo¨ıd kernels.
- Code is implemented with Python.

#### _Multi-scale gradients for Alzheimer’s Disease diagnosis_  `2018.01 - 2019.02`
- Extend the feature pool that is commonly used for characterizing FDG-PET images from the gradient point of view, which is effective yet simple.
- Code is implemented with Matlab and the work is published at __Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine__ and ICFSP 2019.

#### _Multi-level features for Alzheimer’s Disease diagnosis_  `2016.10 - 2017.12`
- Propose to represent FDG-PET images via multi-level features in a hierarchical manner, which considers individual region’s property as well as connections among regions.
- Code is implemented with Matlab and the work is published at __IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics__ and ICIP 2018.

#### _Image Dehazing_ `2013.09 - 2016.01`
- Propose to remove haze from remote sensing images following the idea of dark channel prior based on the haze imaging model.
- Code is implemented with Matlab and these works are published at __IEEE Access__, __IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters__ and __IEEE Signal Processing Letters__.
